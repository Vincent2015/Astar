# Astar
Astar is a simple task manager application for Mac OS X, using NW.js.

## Description
Astar allows you to create your notebooks with your favorite image, in which you can manage your ToDos or WantToDos. These steps are grouped by tags that you define with your favorite color for them, and they are displayed by one of the three modes: bullet list, display by tag, and calendar view. Bullet list contains all the steps in single list, and tag mode encapsulates steps into tags. In calendar mode, you can select monthly,weekly, and daily view. Through list or tag mode, steps can be marked or unmarked, and also type of step (todo, allday, or specific time) can be changed. Calendar mode enables you to visually alternate the date and specifc time corresponding to each task.
